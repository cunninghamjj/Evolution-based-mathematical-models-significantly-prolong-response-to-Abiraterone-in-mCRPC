This repository provides the MATLAB code the analysis in "Multidisciplinary analysis of evolution-based trial for castrate resistant prostate cancer finds long term control is achievable."

Created by Jessica Cunningham (jessica.cunningham at moffitt.org) in the department of Imaging at the Moffitt Cancer Research Institute, Tampa, FL

Publication: In review.

## DATA PROVIDED
In TrialPatientData.mat the PSA data for all patients in the trial is provided in a .mat file format. 

In optimizedModelFits.mat the optimized parameters from completing the grid search code that is presented in the paper is provided. The grid search takes hours to run, therefor, this data is provided. 

## RUNNING THE CODE
Please go to the run.sh file. Here you can comment and uncomment specific pieces of the code to run. The results, either figures or .mat files, will be saved in corresponding directories in the results folder. 

### NOTE: Running the "Figure 2: Grid Search for Optimal parameter values" code R_Beta_GridSearch.m takes hours. The results of this grid search that are used in the manuscript are provided in the data as optimizedModelFits.mat. 

All other files run relatively quickly and can be used to recreate all figures in the manuscript.
